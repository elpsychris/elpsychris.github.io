## Motivation

The blog was inspired by [this wonderful lecture][1] on the study method for students by Prof. Lobdell that I luckily ran into on a certain weekend night.

In the lecture, a famous method of reading and studying textbooks that I first heard of called *SQ4R*.

Basically *SQ4R* is an active learning strategy to boost learning efficiency. 

*SQ4R* includes:

- Survey
- Question
- Read
- Respond
- Record
- Review

*(You can read more about it [here][2])*

Long story short, the whole project is my personal attempt to challenge myself and explore a more active and proficient learning ability for my career.
