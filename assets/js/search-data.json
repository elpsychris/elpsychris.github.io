Random experiments are often conducted repeatedly, so that the collective results may be subjected to statistical analysis. A fixed number of repetitions of the same experiment can be thought of as a composed experiment, in which case the individual repetitions are called trials. (Experiment - Probability Theory, 2021) . Some characteristics of a random experiment includes: . | consists of multiple trials (tossing the coin multiple times). Each trial could produce a different outcome (e.g. head or tail) | a random experiment has a set of all possible outcomes which is called Sample space (e.g. Ω={Head,Tail}\\Omega = \\{Head, Tail\\}Ω={Head,Tail}) | . Sample space (Ω[omega](\\Omega _{[omega]}(Ω[omega]​ or S)S )S) . A set of all possible outcomes associated with a Random experiment. Events. A group of outcomes. All events is a member of F\\mathcal{F}F (\\mathcal{F}) which is a set of all events. Studies and experiments are conducted to deal with the uncertainty by estimate the likelihood of a specified event (e.g. two tossings produces two heads) . Probability. Likelihood of each of the possible events, denoted as a continuous number in range [0,1][0, 1][0,1]. PPP is a function mapping from events to probabilities. ",
