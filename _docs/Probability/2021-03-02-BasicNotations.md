## 1. Random experiment

- Example: Rolling a die

### Why?

- To explain the behavior of a *Random process* (a process we know all possible *outcomes* but unsure when each of them happens)

### How?

- By conducting a large(?) number of trials (repeat the *Random process*) and observe the result at the end [More][1]

### Properties

A random experiment:

- consists of multiple trials (to be an experiment)
- has more than one possible outcome
- has a well-defined set of possible outcomes (i.e. sample space)

## 2. Outcomes, Sample space, Events

### Comparison

|     | Sample space | Outcomes | Events |
| --- | ------------ | -------- | ------ |
|     |              |          |        |
