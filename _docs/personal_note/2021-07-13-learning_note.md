## SQ4R

A popular technique to read learning material {% cite study_less --file learn_books%}. **SQ4R** stands for:

- 4R: Read, Record, Recite, Review

**Survey** Skim through the entire section, chapter. Read section overview, headings, pictures, graphs for a big picture.

**Question** Be skeptical of what you read. Questioning the facts mentioned in book creates a cue to process the information the next time you read. *'Critical thinking skills encourage students to move beyond knowing information and get to the heart of what they really think and believe'* {% cite critic_thinking --file learn_books %}.

**Read, Record, Recite, Review**. The objective is to become more active in learning. Note down what you read. Recite it. Then review the noted content for better material retention.
