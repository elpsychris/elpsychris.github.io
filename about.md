  Hi there, it's me, Nguyen - the author. Hope you had enjoyable reading on my site. The blog is still under development with comment and navigation improvement package is waiting for final delivery so... bear with me, my appologies.
</p>

In 2019, after my graduation I joined Zalo Adtima - one of the biggest Mobile Advertising Platform in Vietnam. At Zalo, our daily tasks are mostly learning about the data and how to tame them into friends on the journey. 

The experience as a half-backend engineer-half-data scientist with the Adtima team made me so exciting that I want to learn more about this subject on the weekends (not because my weekends are boring)

Please contact me if you want to contribute something to the blog:
